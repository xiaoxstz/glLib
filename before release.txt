check all shaders and/or ask RB
Test w/o pygame, numpy, pyopengl to make sure properly crashes
update Shader.use_prebuilt() docs
.use_prebuilt() error printing and document types
Kill useless functions
update depth peel shader list doc
Caustic map switching between render modes (f) the problem is in generating positionmap and normalmap
glLibGridDouble, hair
documentation for the grid functions

admit that the math section exists in one of the tutorials

wx paths for loading objects

add .draw_frustum() method to glLibView*, with arguments for what elements, specifically, to draw.  See Tutorials/shadowmapping.py

change version?

doc glLibGetTimeElements

test glGetTexImage

grid2D in glLibMath

depth peel fbo only should need two fbos

Make functions, classes, etc. reset states after altering them

cubic filtering and my hack need to be finished, and the tutorial needs updating

fbo mipmapping???

document glLibGetProjected note that it returns relative offset with viewport (check that too)

repeated volumetric caustics fails

particle shader variables

names of objects from object names in .obj file?

add fbo.clear() ?

add numbers argument to .save_vertex, .save_fragment?

work on naming conventions so that things like texturing and fireparticle.png don't get screwed up

Cook-Torrence, Lyon, Trowbridge-Reitz, Torrence-Sparrow specular
anisotropic specular Hedrich-Seidel, Ward
Oren–Nayar diffuse
and doc

Remove the rotations garbage from glLibPlane?

PSM http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~tants/tsm/psm.html

distance field sm? http://www.gamedev.net/community/forums/topic.asp?topic_id=571102

check theory, line numbers, getinput, variable naming conventions shader error ouputting, globals, variables, all button combinations for all tutorials!

object exporting?

blinn, gaussian, beckmann with point lights?

add loop argument to glLibFilterSurface, glLibHeightmapToNormalmap

compile to .pyo?

Remove useless tokens

Tutorials ought to test for anisotropy, vbos, etc. before using them

Add vertex normals to glLibRectangularSolid and doc

glLibScreenQuad normal for

change variables of all classes to glLibInternal_

Test culling for faces of glLibRectangularSolid

Add option to use ONLY fragment shader, vertex shader?

objects need uv_repeat=1,uv_delta=0, draw_list, draw_vbo, draw_arrays

make glLibUnwrappedCubemap work by updating textures?  Course then we'd have to manually update it

texturing argument in glLibObject is stupid?

remove useless stuff from data/

material class?

add support for a list to dictate minimum and maximum values for filtering= arguments (glLibTexture*, FBO.add_render_target, etc.  search!)

remove tutorials that don't exist on Tutorial.py.  Remove .pyc too!

glLibObject.set_material() should be able to add materials to objects without materials

all objects need a "apply_transformation" method that permanently transforms their data.

cubic____ for everything (cubemapping)

glLibInternal in shaders.  Document the rest

give the object classes the native ability to link with ODE

describe variables available for use in each class in docs

make updating particles/cloth/hair/etc.? not in vertex shader so less geometry need be drawn?

Name the shaders only used internally GLLIB_CLOTH_DISTANCE, etc. with GLLIBINTERNAL

make GLLIB_CLOTH_DISTANCE shader work with repeats

self.vec_tex in glLibCloth unnecessary?

resizable windows?

solve spotlighting ATI and all other bugs in todo

remove the flipcoords argument in the shadowing functions

delete this file

silhouette shadowmapping, distance field

fbo cubemapping

add flip_normals option to glLibExtrudeLightVolumes

metaball tangents

add offset to glLibOutline for nice effects w/o z-fighting

glLibPaths.py documentation and tutorial

space optimizer for meta objects

3D and 1D FBOs, and 1D textures

remove printing of errors of built-in shaders inside classes where they're made and compiled

change order of "window.clear();__.set_view()" to "__.set_view();window.clear()" in all tutorials

remove glLibGetProjectedFrom?

phong specular shows up on the other side of the object from where it should be as well!  

redocument glLibDome!!!
